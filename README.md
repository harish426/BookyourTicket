BookYourTickets: A Decentralized Ticketing Platform



This document outlines the architecture and functionality of BookYourTickets, a web application designed to facilitate the purchase of tickets using blockchain technology. Built with Solidity for smart contract implementation and integrated with MetaMask for user authentication and transaction management, BookYourTickets offers a secure and transparent platform for event organizers and attendees. This document will cover the core components of the application, including the smart contract logic, web application interface, and the integration with MetaMask.



Core Components



BookYourTickets comprises three main components:







Smart Contract (Solidity): The backbone of the application, responsible for managing ticket creation, sales, and ownership.



Web Application (Frontend): The user interface that allows users to browse events, purchase tickets, and manage their accounts.



MetaMask Integration: Enables users to connect their Ethereum wallets, sign transactions, and interact with the smart contract.



Smart Contract (Solidity)



The smart contract is the heart of BookYourTickets, ensuring secure and transparent ticket transactions. Key functionalities include:







Ticket Creation: Event organizers can create new tickets by specifying event details (name, description, date, venue), total ticket supply, and price.



Ticket Purchase: Users can purchase tickets using Ether (ETH). The smart contract verifies sufficient funds and transfers ownership of the ticket to the buyer.



Ticket Transfer: Ticket holders can transfer their tickets to other users, enabling a secondary market for tickets.



Event Management: Event organizers can manage their events, including updating event details and withdrawing funds collected from ticket sales.



Ownership and Access Control: The contract implements strict access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. For example, only the event organizer can update event details or withdraw funds.
